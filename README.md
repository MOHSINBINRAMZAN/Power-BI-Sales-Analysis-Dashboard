# Power-BI-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

I'm excited to share my latest data visualization project, where I designed an interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key sales metrics, helping businesses make data-driven decisions with ease.



KPI's:

Average Net Quantity ,Total Returns ,Gross Sales ,Discounts

Customer Segments: Detailed insights into customer behavior across different segments.

 Geographical Breakdown: Visual representation of sales performance across various regions.



From tracking monthly sales trends to analyzing returns and discounts by customer segment, this dashboard offers a holistic view that empowers stakeholders to optimize strategies and drive growth.
